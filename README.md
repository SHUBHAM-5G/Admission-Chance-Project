# Admission-Chance-Project
Predicting chances of admission using machine learning (YBI Foundation Internship Project)
# 🎓 Admission Chance Prediction Project

This project predicts the **chance of admission** for students based on their academic profile using machine learning.  
It was developed as part of the **YBI Foundation 45-Days Internship**.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is:  
[Admission Chance Dataset](https://github.com/ybifoundation/Dataset/raw/main/Admission%20Chance.csv)

**Features in the dataset:**
- `GRE Score`  
- `TOEFL Score`  
- `University Rating`  
- `SOP` (Statement of Purpose Strength)  
- `LOR` (Letter of Recommendation Strength)  
- `CGPA`  
- `Research` (0 = No, 1 = Yes)  

**Target Variable:**
- `Chance of Admit`

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Pandas (Data Analysis)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (Visualization)
- Scikit-learn (ML Algorithms)
- Google Colab (Development Environment)

---

## 📌 Steps Covered
1. Data Import & Exploration  
2. Data Preprocessing  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Splitting Dataset into Train & Test  
5. Building Machine Learning Model (Linear Regression)  
6. Model Evaluation  
7. Predictions  

---

## 📈 Output Example
- Sample Prediction of admission chance: `0.92`  
- Model Performance: (add metrics if you calculated, e.g. R² Score)
